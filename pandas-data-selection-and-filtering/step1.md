# Selecting Columns with Pandas

First, let's open up a python interactive shell:
`python`{{execute}}


First let's import the pandas library and rename it as 'pd':
`import pandas as pd`{{execute}}

For our demonstration we will be using the Austin Animal Shelter data set. Let's import the data into a data frame:

`df = pd.read_csv("aac_shelter_outcomes.csv")`{{execute}}

`print(df.head())`{{execute}}
