# Importing The Data

In this Post we will be ussing the Pandas library in python to demonstration data selection and filtering. We will be usin The Wine Reviews data set for out demonstration. 


First, let's import the pandas library:

```import pandas as pd```{{execute}}

Next, let's read the data into a pandas data frame

```df = pd.read_csv("wines.csv")```{{execute}}

Here's a block of runnable code:

```
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = a + b + c

d
```{{execute}}
